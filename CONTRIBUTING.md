# Contributing to the Goodreads Scraper API

Thank you for considering contributing to the **Goodreads Scraper API**! This project is powered by caffeine, passion, and the occasional bug fix â€” and weâ€™d love for you to be part of the journey.

## How You Can Help

1. **Bug Reports**: If you encounter bugs or strange behavior, report them! (Preferably before Iâ€™ve had my coffee. ðŸ˜…)
   
2. **Feature Requests**: Have a feature in mind that could make this API even more awesome? Open an issue or create a pull request!

3. **Code Contributions**: Got some code to share? Fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Donâ€™t forget to run tests first, or Iâ€™ll have to run them for you... after my coffee.

4. **Documentation**: If you spot a mistake or an area that needs better explanation in the docs, feel free to jump in and improve them! Better docs = fewer "Why doesnâ€™t this work?" messages.

5. **Coffee Donations**: If you really want to support the project, consider [buying me a coffee](buymeacoffee.com/ebrahimkhalil) â€” it'll help fuel the caffeine addiction required to keep this project alive! â˜•ðŸ’»

## How to Get Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Make your changes or fixes.
4. Test everything thoroughly (or as thoroughly as possible while caffeinated).
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of what youâ€™ve changed or added.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and kind. Weâ€™re all here to make the project better â€” and keep the coffee flowing! ðŸ¤—
